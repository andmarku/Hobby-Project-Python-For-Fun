First try using the Statistics Sweden API
===
For this project I adapted code from the pyscbwrapper project (https://github.com/kirajcg/pyscbwrapper/blob/master/pyscbwrapper_en.ipynb), 
which provides a class for interacting with the Statistics Sweden API as well an example of how it can be used.

The two figures illustrate how swedish household savings in funds has changed over the last year. The data used for the figures comes from Statistics Sweden, see http://www.statistikdatabasen.scb.se/pxweb/en/ssd/.
