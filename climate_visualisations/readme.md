In this mini Python project, I visualise how the temperature in Uppsala has changes over the years. The visualisation was inspired by: https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/hottest-year-on-record/.

The temperature data was accessed from https://www.smhi.se/data/meteorologi/temperatur/uppsalas-temperaturserie-1.2855. For more information on it see: Bergstr√∂m, H., Moberg, A. : Daily air temperature and pressure series for Uppsala (1722-1998), Climate Change, 53:213-252.

See the file temperature_over_years.gif for the resulting visualisation.
